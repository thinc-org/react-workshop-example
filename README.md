# Thinc.'s React Workshop : Example code

This small web app is design to demonstrate how React works, in a relatively smaller way than the [official React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) (the tic-tac-toe app)

We assume no basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, or even _HTML_ before participating in this workshop. The workshop going to take 3 hours and going to go from installing `node` to finishing this web application. 

We do not expect to go over `App.css`. We wrote it to demonstrate how one can import and use CSS in a react app.

The guide is designed to be very rough and very fast paced. Participants are likely to need a good amount of self study afterwards.

This repository contains the _(expected)_ code after workshop ends.
